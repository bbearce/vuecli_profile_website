# Germany Trip
## Day 3: Relaxing in Hanau

Admittedly this is going to be a boring post. I am working while in Germany and today I told Tsukimi I needed to catch up on work and instead of exploring a ton in the city we walked a little but then I worked most of the day. 

Tukimi as usual spoiled me (and my taste buds forever) with her cooking. We had Japanese food for lunch and dinner today.

#### Lunch

More salmon and nato (slimy fermented soy beans.) Tsukimi says Germans don't really like it but it's awesome. I highly recommend if you haven't tried. 

Here is a quick pick of nato up close so you can know what I'm talking about.

#### Dinner

> Beet salad and believe me it was awesome. It had flower oil and some light cheesy pieces to make it delectable. So healty considering all the German sausage I'll be eating.

#### Desert

> Japanese Moochi. Pretty awesome and sweet. A nice finish with a little tea.


Tsukimi, Ich liebe dich und danke, dass du mir all die mütterliche Liebe gegeben hast, die man sich wünschen kann.

#### Bonus

When I can I will share about random culture things like window types and construction to this little cute number. It's a chip clip lol. However I loved it and it was typical of german things which are made with great quality and compact.

PS: There is like a decent chance it's Japanese, but I don't remember...I will ask Tsukimi to be sure. ;)
