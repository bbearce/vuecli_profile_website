### Saturday Fun Day

#### Marketplatz

Tsukimi took me into Hanau to the marketplatz to see the town center and the farmers market. It's about time I debut some German sausage and meat in general.

> It's worth mentioning there were plenty of vegetarian options and veggies. I don't want it to look like Germans only eat meat. If you get a chance, try a German salad. They are really good!

I had a standard bratwurst on breat with mustard and it was great! I did see (but didn't try) some of the meat with tons of gelatin in it. It looked weird to me honestly. I'm sure someone likes it but I can't help but think it is filer (Es tut mir leid, wenn jemand beleidigt ist).  

Also I think it's worth mentioning in Germany (and I believe Europe) they use cash and coins more than the US. It's actually practical as a coin is an entire Euro or even 2. In the states we have quarters and we should really make whole dollar and 2 dollar coins...would be an upgrade.

Piggybacking on that convo is a cool little register I saw many people use that had various slots for different coin types. To me this is a little window into german culture...be organized. Like really organized. I feel like we have "buckets" in our cash registers for coins of different types. By bucket I mean like a small tray for quarters, but they are swimming around in chaos! I like this better.

Before heading to the castle in Hanau, we saw this little church:

### Schloss Philippsruhe – Unglaublich Märchenhaft (Philippsruhe Castle – Incredibly Fabulous)


We then walked around a little more and visited a "small" castle:

### Cafe Exzess

More to come in the next post but my Boston roommate Yuki has friends back in Germany and Chistopher Kresch showed me around in Frankfurt this evening. We went to Cafe Exzess which is a punk rock like bar and cinema, but it's known for hosting meetings for activists and planning how to help migrants and those discriminated against find a safe space. They have a cool library that is apparently famous and has a catalog of many activist history in Germany\Frankfurt and abroad. Tonight they were celebrating the centers birthday and there was dancing and a live band but I missed it! Grrrrr. Anyways I got a chance to practice German a little and I was able to talk to some folks and they were very friendly.

Many thanks to Kresch and Kata for showing me around and driving to and from the festivities.

> I know the images are terrible but I tried. I also didn't want to look sketchy. This photo says "Vielen dank für die blümen" which means thanks very much for the flowers, but it's ironic as the flowers are on fire and look like a molotov cocktail. Like I said, they are activits.

It should be noted that sometimes these events get a bad rap for being rebels without a cause but to be honest they seem to be doing great work and they were very cognizant of recycling and handing people their deposit back for bottles returned. They also had free food for people and I just can't say enough about how nice and proactive they were for human rights.
