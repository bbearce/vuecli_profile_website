# Germany Trip
## Day 1: BOS -> DUB -> FRA

### On the plane
Got to the airport early and checked my larger bag. I love [Aer Lingus](https://www.aerlingus.com/html/en-IE/home.html). Smooth ride and great staff. I have to admit I was a bit nervous when over the middle of the atlantic...

### DUB - Dublin Airport
I landed in Dublin, Ireland and hung out a bit. I couldn't sleep well on the plane so thought I'd try not sleeping. I've heard it takes 3 days to a week to get over jet lag. My thought was if I don't sleep at all, while I will be tired, I can just go to bed at a normal time once in Germany. This sorf of worked, however I underestimated how even though I went to bed at a normal time in Germany (10pm) and got 8 hours of sleep, the next day wasn't easy. I made to about 2pm and then started yawning every 15 minutes or so. Seems I was still missing a whole day's worth of sleep. 

### FRA - Frankfurt Airport
Customs was easy. They had an express customs (I think) for EU members and some other countries. I think if you travel a lot you can get an express pass. There were no security guards for this section and people were scanning their passports in automated machines. 

Needless to say this was not me. I had to wait in the normal line but it wasn't too long. The customs officer asked me my business and let me though. She did have me prove I was returning home by showing my return flight.

Once I got my bag I wanted to get some Euros and remembered my friend Zach told me that I should be careful with my debit\credit cards as I could lose both with them being in the same wallet. He mentioned separating them and leaving one in my bag and keep another on me. He told me a story about being in South America and our mutual friend Andrea Cerrilla put her debit card in an ATM and the machine just ate her card and never returned it. So with that hanging over my head I used the ATM and I was lucky haha. No issues!

### Hanau Hauptbahnhof
My next stop was Hanau, Germany to meet my roommates mother Tsukimi. On my way snapped a pic of the snack shop in the train station. In the words of Dave Skylark, "Feast your eyes"!

"Wiener Feinbäcker"

Really hope I didn't creep out the woman working there. I didn't realize she was looking at me till later when I looked back at the photo (Es tut mir Leid!).

### S9 - To Hanau

I took a train to Hanau from Frankfurt. It was one way to keep things simple although there are connections and busses I could have taken as well.

### Chemnitzer Straße, Hanau

My roommate's mother Tsukimi lives in Hanau, Germany as I mentioned and her home I learned is an old army barracks. Many things were destroyed during the war but these army barracks (built for americans to be stationed in during the cold war) survived and are now apartments (Wohnungen).

Here is Tsukimi and I:

Tsukimi cooks amazing Japanese food and I would be remiss if I didn't share examples of her cooking prowess.
