These are the names of Turkish and German residents who were shot in a hookah bar in Hanau, Germany on the 19th of February 2020. All of the victims were people of color and were the children of immigrants. We Americans are unfortunately getting our senses blunted to actions like these. In Hanau, this was considered especially heinous as Europe in general has hardly any guns in the hands of civilians. It's an example of the hate that unfortunately still exists in many places towards immigrants. It begs the question of what does it mean to be German? To be American? Is it a race or a culture? It seems this is likely to continue if we value the former as the definition.  

Metzgerstraße is a street in Hanau and is also the name given to this building. I was lucky enough to have a friend of my roommates named Christopher Krech show me around the city and his house in Hanau. This building is a refuge for immigrants and a reminder that hate and violence are still ever present in Germany and all over the world. People here help those who may not speak the native language integrate and provide a friendly and safe space for them to land on their travels to Germany. It is a volunteer effort though it would seem many natives in Germany support the effort and it is alive and well.

The building may look intense with graffiti and activist-like decor and that's because it's part of a larger community in Hanau and Frankfurt, in general, that stands up for human rights for all and fight the powers that intend to spread fear, hate, and keep classism the norm. 

### Yuki's Old House

Today's post was meant to be about my roommate in Boston's old stomping grounds in Hanau. While I did learn about that first, after hearing about Metzgerstraße, it seemed that that had to be the first thing I mentioned here.

Nonetheless, there is more to this day. For those of you that lived at Aldie at one time or another, this section is for you! Yuki moved into this house around 15 or 16 years old.

Those of you who have lived at Aldie and enjoyed affordable rent in the middle of Boston's huge rent prices will feel at home with this story.

Basically, we all know landlords right? They want to keep upping prices and maximize profit. What if no one owned the house? Or rather, what if no one person owned the house? There would be no motivation to up the rent as no one gets the money.

Enter the [Mietshäuser Syndikat und die Hausprojekt](https://www.syndikat.org/en/) (Apartment Buildings Syndicate and the House Project). Basically, the German equivalent to an LLC was created to be the owner of houses all over Germany:

<br><br><br><br><br>

> The above translates to: The houses to those who live in them.

> The other comments: (1) This is our house (2) Affordable and not for sale (3) Independent and social

They have locations all over Germany:

<br><br><br><br><br>

The numbers indicate how many houses are in that area. Technicallly the Mietshäuser Syndikat is the LLC like entity referred to as GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) which translates to Company with limited liability.

> Each house is its own GmbH called a Hausbesitz (Home ownership) and the leaders of each house are apart of a Hausverein (House club).

The Syndikat is an overarching entity that controls all the houses and can handle disputes and reallocate money for repairs and other needs as necessary. Essentially to get this all started some more leftist and social banks took a chance and provided loans to the first houses. These are long 30-year mortgages and the rent tenants pay goes towards that mortgage. At first, the rent was roughly the same as rents in the area, drawing criticism and skepticism that this actually helps keep rent cheap. This however is a long game... See over time all other properties in the area owned by landlords naturally have their rent increased. These houses never increase the rent. Some of these houses have the same rent price they had 20-30 years ago. The rent is only increased if necessary for upkeep in some way.

Each house is its own GmbH. This is to distribute the control of each house to a few trusted leaders who hold meetings to discuss house needs. In case any leader tries to do something, not in the spirit of the Syndikat, the Syndikat has the power to disapprove and keep that from happening. The Syndikat for instance does not allow individual houses to charge more rent than necessary or for the leaders to sell for profit. 

### Enough already, more Yuki and the house!!!

Yuki used to have a nickname that translated to "two left hands" as he wasn't that good at construction (at first) ;). Anyone in Boston who knows Yuki knows he's a master at home improvement. He has led the way in our Boston apartment with home repairs. Together we jackhammered a hole in the basement to put in a sump pump, installed the pipes needed to evacuate the water that was pumped out, and even mounted a ceiling-hung projector for our living room entertainment. At this point maybe he should have the name "two right hands" as he certainly measures twice before cutting once.
